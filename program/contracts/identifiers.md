# Stable Identifier System

Every substantive item receives a stable identifier.

## Required namespaces

| ID         | Meaning                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `DEC-###`  | Accepted decision records            |
| `REC-###`  | Research recommendations             |
| `REQ-###`  | Normative specification requirements |
| `FND-###`  | Adversarial review findings          |
| `RSK-###`  | Risks                                |
| `OQ-###`   | Open questions                       |
| `SPK-###`  | Evidence spikes                      |
| `PHASE-##` | Implementation phases                |
| `MS-###`   | Implementation milestones            |

Optional: `EVD-###` (Evidence Ledger entries), `ASM-###` (assumptions).

## Allocation

The Program Blueprint and manifest allocate non-overlapping ranges by stage
before use. Example:

```text
Focused Research 1: REC-001..REC-099
Focused Research 2: REC-100..REC-199
Specification: REQ-001..REQ-399
Specification Review: FND-001..FND-199
Plan Review: FND-200..FND-399
```

## Stability rules

- Never reuse an identifier for a different subject.
- Preserve identifiers when a subject is modified.
- Mark deleted items superseded or rejected; do not silently remove history.
- Later stages must disposition every material upstream identifier in scope.
- Findings remain traceability items; they do not automatically become
  requirements.
